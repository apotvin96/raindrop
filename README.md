# VKGuide Rust

Replicating the wonderful VKGuide (Legacy 1.1) guide in rust. The attempt is to switch myself over to Rust from C++. Since I am already familiar with Vulkan, I am using this to focus my attention on writing things the "rusty" way.

## Goals

* Complete (up to my needs) the VKGuide series of chapters
* Learn some Rust by running into a wall at least a bit
* Replicate my existing PBR based renderer, originally in C++, in Rust
